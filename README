ORIGINAL VERSION
================

The original version of this script by 'borjalopezm' can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/pycbds/

MODIFICATIONS
=============

I made manga mode just apply the internal ini setting, rather than reversing the file order of the images.
You can still reverse the file order with -r, if you need that functionality.

I also improved the resizing algorithm - if you set a maximum size for both dimensions,
images will be proportionally resized to fit within those maximums.

INSTALLATION
============

Copy pycbds into /usr/bin/

USAGE
=====

Parameters can be listed with "pycbds -h"

A basic example:

	pycbds -i /home/user/comic.zip

An example for manga (the settings I use most often):

	pycbds -i /home/user/manga.zip -o /home/user/manga.cbds -n "Manga Name" -a "Author" -p "Source Website" -q 60 --wp 1000 --hp 1000 --lr 0
